### JavaScript syntax:

JavaScript is a case-sensitive language. It uses the Unicode character set and supports both single-line and multi-line comments. It uses the semicolon (;) to mark the end of a statement.

### JavaScript statements:

JavaScript statements are used to perform actions in a program. JavaScript statements are separated by semicolons (;). JavaScript statements can be grouped into three categories: declarations, assignments, and expressions.

## Variables & Data Types:

### Understanding variables in JavaScript:

A variable is a container for storing data values. In JavaScript, variables are declared using the "var", "let", or "const" keyword. The "var" keyword is used to declare variables with global or function scope. The "let" keyword is used to declare variables with block scope. The "const" keyword is used to declare variables that cannot be reassigned.

### Declaring variables and assigning values:

```js
// Declaring a variable with the var keyword
var age;
```

```js
// Assigning a value to a variable
age = 25;
```

```js
// Declaring and assigning a value to a variable
var name = "John";
```

### Data types in JavaScript: numbers, strings, booleans, etc.:

JavaScript supports various data types, including numbers, strings, booleans, null, undefined, and objects.

```js
// Number
var age = 25;

// String
var name = "John";

// Boolean
var isMarried = true;

// Null
var car = null;

// Undefined
var bike;

// Object
var person = { name: "John", age: 25 };
```
